# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Random-Forest

This data has been taken from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data

The bike sharing systems are a means of renting bikes that are in the process of doing membership Rantel and bike return is automated via a network of good locations throughout the city using the systems. People are able to rent the bike on location and return it to a different place. Currently there are over 500 by action programs around the world.
 
It is interesting that data generated but these systems are very attractive for researchers because everything is recorded. Things like the ration of travel departure location arrival location and the time elapsed is all things that are recorded.

And the data set itself contains 14 independent variables and my main goal is basically to get the count of runs as output of my machine learning model.
